      <h3>Chapter One: Vingt Euros</h3>

        <p>"Vous payez quinze euros pour les bieres?"</p>

        <p>Antoine sighed. He hadn't realized that Jean was behind him.</p>

        <p>"Marine est ici."</p>

        <p>Jean rolled his eyes.</p>

        <p>"Deux cafes coutent quatre euros a Paul's."</p>

        <p>"J'ai vingt euros. C'est bon."</p>

        <p>"Bon, tu as un bon soir," Jean said, shaking his head. He patted him on the back and turned to leave the bar.</p>

        <p>Antoine returned to the table where Marine sat looking bored.</p>

        <p>"J'ai les bieres."</p>

        <p>She seemed to notice him for the first time.</p>

        <p>"Tu as les cacahuetes et les olives?"</p>

      <h3>Chapter 2: Quoi?</h3>

        <p>"Qu'est-ce que vous regardez a le tele?"</p>

        <p>Antoine had returned from his date with Marine to find Jean, Marc and Toussaint in the tiny living room crowded around the tiny TV. The screen was hidden from him by their heads, but he could hear a woman's voice vaguely.

        <p>Jean glanced at him then turned back to the television. He had had a very odd look on his face.<p/>

        <p>"Qu'est-ce que c'est?"</p>

        <p>The others moved aside so that Antoine could see. At first he thought it was just a news report on escaped criminals, but then he saw what the others had seen.</p>

        <p>"Les hommes dangereux se sont évadés d'une prison de haute sécurité. S'il vous regardez ces hommes, appellez-vous votre poste de police."</p>

        <p>The woman gestured to the images of the criminals in the corner of the screen. Though the men were wearing prison clothes and had different haircuts, they were clearly recognizable. Marc. Toussaint. Jean. And himself, Antoine.</p>

       <p>Antoine felt as if something was failing to click into place. It didn't make sense.</p>

       <p>"Quoi?"</p>

      <h3>Chapter 3: Une Erreur</h3>

      <p>"Je ne sais pas."</p>

      <p>Jean twisted his silver stud earring, a sign of extreme agitation.</p>

      <p>"Qu'est-ce nous ferons?"</p>

      <p>Marc looked back and forth between Antoine and Jean.</p>

      <p>Antoine looked back at the tv. Under the pictures were names: under his picture was the name Stephane Morel, 
        under Marc's was the name Phillipe Lemaire, Toussaint's Pierre Morin, and Jean's Andre Aubert.</p>

      <p>"Peut être c'est une erreur," Antoine said slowly. "Regardons sur l'ordinateur."</p>

      <p>He booted up their ancient computer on the table next to the tv. The logo stayed on the screen for an agonisingly long time. 
        Finally the Internet loaded. He typed in "Stephane Morel".</p>

      <p>Other than the current news, the only thing that came up was a news article from 20 years ago. It was titled 
        "Criminels Responsables De 15 Vols De Banque Arrêtés."</p>

      <p>Morel, Lemaire, Morin and Aubert had been arrested for a long string of bank robberies and sentenced to 50 years in a 
        high-security prison in Paris. There was almost no other information. But there were more pictures - and in the pictures, 
        taken when the criminals were in their 20s, the identical appearance to him and his friends was even clearer.</p>

     <p>"Pourraient-ils être liés à nous?" Marc asked slowly.</p>

     <p>"Sosies?" Antoine suggested.</p>

     <p>"Univers parallèle?" Toussaint guessed, eyes wide.</p>

     <p>Jean crossed his arms.</p>

     <p>"Eh bien, quoi que ce soit, ce n'est pas bon."</p>

     <p>"Qu'allons nous faire?" Toussaint asked.</p>

     <p>They all looked at Jean.</p>
